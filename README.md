## How to Use the Alpha Sanctuary Mod Pack

The Alpha Sanctuary Mod Pack has been meticulously developed by Valor to offer an immersive and enjoyable Minecraft experience. While there are multiple methods to set up the mod pack, we highly recommend the following steps for a seamless experience:

1. **Download ATLauncher**: Begin by downloading ATLauncher from their official [website](https://atlauncher.com).

2. **Download the Mod Pack**: After installing ATLauncher, obtain the Alpha Sanctuary mod pack from our Google Drive [Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10ZYBfPFkxQMtwjWuW3uP6Y0eCVCV2yr_/view).

3. **Import Mod Pack**: Launch ATLauncher and navigate to the "Instances" tab. In the upper left corner, click on "Import" and then "Browse" to select the downloaded mod pack file. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the import.

4. **Play the Mod Pack**: Once the import process is finished, head to the "Instances" tab again and click "Play" on the Alpha Sanctuary Mod Pack to start your adventure!

### Recommended Client and Mod Formats

The recommended client for Alpha Sanctuary Minecraft is ATLauncher due to its compatibility and ease of use with the mod pack. However, you may also choose other clients that support the modrith export format. While configuring mods manually with the provided mod list is possible, we strongly discourage this approach. Doing so may lead to decreased performance and require considerable effort on your part.
